			<h1>Why Vet?</h1>
			<p>As my 7th birthday was approaching I was just as eager as every little kid before their birthday.  I had already given a list of things I wanted from my parents including a Nintendo 64, gameboy, pokemon, and a boom box.  So by the time I saw wrapped gifts sitting on the table next to my birthday cake I couldn’t help but wonder what was in the boxes.  One had to be a gameboy because It was a really small box another looked like a stereo, but the last one I had no idea.  The third box was way to long to be any of the things I had mentioned on my list.  Finally the time came to open my presents.  First, I tore into the small package a gameboy, and the other a boom box.  Next I broke of the wrapping paper on the third box tore the box open and stared speechless at the box.  “Don’t you like it?” my mom asked.  I was still trying to figure it out and if somehow they had bought the wrong thing.  “What is it?” I asked.  “It’s a net so that you can catch little critters in the pond behind the house.”</p>
			<p>The next couple weeks I spent playing my new gameboy while listening to music on my new boom box, but I never touched that net.  Finally I decided there was no point in it just sitting there so I took it out of the box.  It was a three foot long bass master fishing net with too small of holes for even the smallest fish to escape.  So I went out back behind my house swung the downwards into the water and pulled in.  And what do you know I caught a whole net full of mud, awesome.  I make a couple more swings and after looking into a net full of mud for the tenth time I decide this is lame and a waste of time.  But wait, before I dumped the mud back into the pond movement caught my eye.  I dip the bottom of the net into the water and shake it to get the excess mud to seep out through the holes.  Then pull the net back to myself and look in.  To my utter shock there was a little black ball with a tail wriggling around in the net.  I barge into my house excited as ever with net in hand. “Mom, Mom look what I caught!” She then explained to me that it was a tadpole and that it would eventually turn into a frog, but it needs water or it will die.  I ran back outside filled a bucket with water and dumped my pet into the bucket.  I watched it swim around for a long time in amazement. I couldn’t believe what I caught, I couldn’t believe this little fish thing was going to turn into a frog, and most of all I wanted to know what else was out there in that pond.  The next day my mom told me that I couldn’t keep the tadpole because we didn’t have the food it needs.  Much to my disappointment I had to release the tadpole back into the pond, but that didn’t stop me from wanting to find more in this pond.</p>
			<p>I started going out there every day after school.  I would try to sneak up on frogs and bring the net down around them before they jumped away.  They were almost always too fast for me, but that didn’t stop me from trying.  Even though the frogs tended to escape me I caught many more tadpoles and even a few little fish.  Every time I pulled in a different animal I wanted to know what it exactly it was.  I got better and better at this to the point where I was more amazed when I pulled in a net that was empty than one with something inside.  The frogs were starting to lose the battle and wind up in a net with some kid starting down at them with a smile.  I found new tactics to catch them like putting the net in the water and slowly moving it under the frog then pulling up leaving them nowhere to go while they float on the surface completely oblivious.  I started inviting friends over and catching frogs and whatnot and we would make a day out of catching these animals.  We would all take a turn catching frogs then we would all put our frog down on the ground and see whose would win the race back to the pond.  Usually my friends couldn’t catch anything so I would catch a frog for them which made me pretty proud of myself.</p>  
			<p>My favorite part though was the first time a caught a turtle.  I saw a head peeking out of the water and instantly knew it was no fish or frog, but had no idea what it was.  I had to catch it, it was my new mission.  I kept going to the lake trying and trying but it was always too far out to reach and much quicker than any frog.  Finally I decided to just sit very still with the net in the water and wait for this creature to move closer until it was in my reach and catch it by surprise.  It worked but then when I looked into the net I was confused.  What was this thing?  It was some shell and it didn’t move at all.  I was so confused and wondered if this was even the thing I’d been trying to catch or just some weird rock.  I picked it up and looked at it.  It wasn’t just a rock!  There was a head and feet and arms and even a tail all curled up into its shell.  I set it on the ground and waited for something.  For a while there was nothing but then finally a little head peeked out and it took a few steps.  It was the coolest thing I had ever caught.  I kept it for about a week after begging my mom to go to the pet store and buy some turtle food.  It was great having a pet turtle and all my friends were jealous, but I decided I should let him go back to his home.  I had caught everything I could in that lake, but my thirst wasn’t quenched.  These animals had sparked a flame in me that I had no way of turning off.  I wanted to know everything there was to know about animals like what other amazing creatures were out there.  Do other things hide in shells like turtles?  Do other animals spring off their back feet like frogs?  I had to know and spent a lot of my time trying to figure it out either y watching animal planet or something else.  When I heard of a profession called “Veterinarian” where you are an animal doctor and must know everything there is to know about the animals I was set.  Weather this was always my fate to be a vet or if it’s because of some net I will never know but either way that net was the best thing anyone had ever given me.</p>
